Milestone 1: Develop methods to aggregate Mechanical Turker response data (6 points total)
* Develop method to identify bad workers (2 points)
* Develop method to identify the best photo(s) in a set of similar photos (2 points)
* Develop method to use metadata (time stamps, geolocation) to group photos (2 points)

Milestone 2: Set up the HIT (7 points total)
* Allow users to upload photos (1 point)
* Create three different HITs (using our three comparison methods) based on the same photoset
  1. X vs Y - Turker sees two images and picks the better one until the Turker has compared every combination of two images from the photoset (2 points)
  2. Subsets - Turker continuously picks subsets of the best images from the photoset until the best image is identified (2 points)
  3. Rate - Turker rates the images from 1 to 10; images are then ordered by rating to determine the best image (1 point)
* Upload HITs to Mechanical Turk and allow Turkers to work and make the results accessible to the requester (1 point)

Milestone 3: Analyze the different comparison methods (4 points total)
* Determine the best images from the uploaded photoset in advance (1 point)
  * Selecting for not blurry, not overly saturated, not rotated pictures
  * People (if there are any) looking at camera, eyes open, no red-eye
* Compare the three Turker-produced photosets with our predetermined best images (2 points)
  * Calculate percentage correct for each comparison method (1 point)

Milestone 4: Analyze results and produce a video (3 points total)
* Compile results from Milestone 3 and produce a video as final deliverable (3 points)

Total: 20 points
